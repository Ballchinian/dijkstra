Dijkstra 
If something of the form "010\n101\n010" is given (and with each line break its a new layer so it would be of the form:
010
101
010
Then the shortest weight of a path going from the top left to the bottom right is given. A paths individual weight is defined as the difference between adjacent numbers.
